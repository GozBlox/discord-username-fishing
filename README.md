## FaQ:
### Q: Why when I choose everything, the number of characters and how many to print for username, why doesn't it print?:
- A: The reason lies in the number of characters in the username. If the number of characters is less, the username creation time will be longer. If the number of characters is large and the username is not created, the problem lies in the strength of your internet connection. If the problem is not in these two, open the issue and write your problem
### Q: Why Arabic In Termux is bad:
- A: Termux does not support Arabic language/Only Pydroid supports it
